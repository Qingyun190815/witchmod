# The Witch
A new character for **Slay The Spire**

The Witch mod features 75+ new cards and 4 new relics.
Her main theme is **Curses**: her starting relic (Black Cat) adds a temporary random curse to the draw pile at the beginning of each combat, but grants 1 energy everytime you draw a curse. This means that adding a curse to the deck is not always a bad thing, and many other cards in her set interact with curses in interesting ways.

I think she's probably a bit on the weaker side compared to the Ironclad or the Silent, expecially in the early stages, and it will take some practice to understand how to play and deckbuild her at the fullest of her potential. Feel free to write your opinions and suggestions to make her more balanced and fun to play.

A list of the cards can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19tAd2g6CMNSAXdArFp2ZNpAosv3Rltb3qv1Cnc40RSk/edit?usp=sharing).

## New mechanics ##
* **Recurrent**: when a Recurrent card is played it's shuffled in the draw pile instead of being discarded.
* **Cleanse**: there are some special cleansable Curses, which normally are unplayable. Each of them can be Cleansed by achieving a certain objective during the fight, unlocking its hidden power. Note that the Curse will be cleansed only for the current fight.

## New status effects ##
* **Rot**: similar to Poison, in that this debuff deal damage to the enemy each turn. Unlike Poison though, Rot **increases** by 1 each turn, instead of decreasing.
* **Decrepit**: creatures afflicted by Decrepit suffer 1 extra damage from attacks for each stack. Each turn Decrepit is decreased by 1.

# How to install
The following guide is basically a copy paste of the one found here: https://github.com/gskleres/FruityMod-StS
Since it's so well written and clear I felt no reason to rewrite it :)

## Requirements ##
* Java 8 (JRE). Currently only Java 8 should be used, issues with Java 9 are being looked into.
* BaseMod v.3.3.0+ (https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/releases)
* ModTheSpire v3.3.0+ (https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire/releases)

## Installation ##
1. If you have `ModTheSpire` already installed you can skip to step 5. Otherwise continue with step 2:
2. Download `ModTheSpire.jar` from the latest release (https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire/releases)
3. Move `ModTheSpire.jar` into your **Slay The Spire** directory. This directory is likely to be found under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire`. Place `ModTheSpire.jar` in that directory so it looks like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\ModTheSpire.jar`
4. Create a `mods` folder in your **Slay The Spire** directory so it looks like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\mods`
5. Download `BaseMod.jar` from the latest release (https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/releases)
6. Move `BaseMod.jar` into the `mods` folder you created in step 4
7. Download `WitchMod.jar` from the latest release (https://github.com/gygrazok/witchmod/releases)
8. Move `WitchMod.jar` into the `mods` folder you created in step 4
9. Your modded version of **Slay The Spire** can now be launched by double-clicking on `ModTheSpire.jar`
10. This will open a mod select menu where you need to make sure that both `BaseMod` and `WitchMod` are checked before clicking **play**

## Art Assets ##
Except for the recolored STS assets, all other (crappy) art has been made by me (except for Demonfyre, submitted by mnmix), sometimes by modifying existing CC0 (public domain) assets by various authors. If you want to use these assets in your own mod, feel free to do so, although it would be nice to credit this mod as the source.
If you want to submit new, better art for this mod, you are more than welcome.
